```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1
```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Clean the data
```{r}

pols_df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")

litters_df = 
  read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv", na = c("NA",".","")) # Fix the missingness
litters_df = 
  janitor::clean_names(litters_df) # cleaning up the names

pups_df = 
  read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv", skip = 3, na = c("NA",".",""))
pups_df = 
  janitor::clean_names(pups_df)

```


```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7)+
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time in January 2013",
    x = "Time (h)",
    y = "Temperature (F)"
  )

ggsave("temp_vs_time_hour.png", width = 8, height = 5)
```

Temperature rises and falls with a daily cycle (with higher temperature during the day and lower during the night). Humidity tends to be higher when temperatures are lower. In addition, as time increases, humidity and temperature generally increases. 

## Problem 2
This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

Create a data frame comprised of:
```{r}
# a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(10)

df = tibble(
  x_numeric = x,
  x_logic = x > 0, # a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  x_char = letters[1:10], # a character vector of length 10
  x_fac = factor(rep(c("low","medium","high"), length.out = 10)) # a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
)
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t?
Hint: for now, to take the mean of a variable in a dataframe, you need to pull the variable out of the dataframe. Try loading the tidyverse and using the pull function.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mean(pull(df, x_numeric)) # works
mean(pull(df, x_logic)) # works
mean(pull(df, x_char)) # warning - returning NA
# mean(pull(df, x_fac) # error - unexpected symbol, comment this line
```

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?
```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
as.numeric(pull(df, x_logic)) # 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
as.numeric(pull(df, x_char)) # NAs introduced by coercion 
as.numeric(pull(df, x_fac)) # 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
```
* Converting logic variables to numeric maps `TRUE = 1` and `FALSE = 0`. That means why taking the mean of a logical vector works
* Character cannot be directly coerced to numeric, so R produces `NA` with a warning. That’s why `mean()` fails on characters.
* Converting factor to numeric works. `as.numeric()` maps ordinal data to integers (`low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3`). However, `mean()` on a raw factor takes mean on original ordinal data instead of the numeric data, and that's why there's an error when doing that.
